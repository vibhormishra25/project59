        <div id="ab" class="line"></div>Football is a game that millions of people around the world play and love. It can be called a universal game because every small and big nation plays it. Moreover, it's a great relaxer, stress reliever, teacher of discipline and teamwork. Apart from that, it keeps the body and mind fit and healthy.
        My favarite hobby is playing football.It is my favorite game. I start playing footall with my friends at 5:00 O'clock in evening and finish game at 7:00 O'clock. After that we discuss about the next game we will play, most of time we play hide and seek.

                <p> my Ispritation is messsie he is a plyer of fc balaconea This was not how it was supposed to end. Lionel Messi was meant to retire at FC Barcelona, a one-club player in the mould of Paolo Maldini or Francesco Totti. And indeed, were it not for La Liga’s financial fair play rules, he might just have been. Unfortunately for the club and the player, Spain’s top-flight league prioritised Barcelona cleaning up their financial mess over keeping Messi. At some level, it is easy to see why. Barca are in debt of over a billion euros. All big clubs have a degree of debt but this… well, this is quite something else.</p>

                <p> my favorite work in football is attacker Forwards are the players on an association football team who play nearest to the opposing team's goal, and are therefore most responsible for scoring goals. Their advanced position and limited defensive responsibilities mean forwards normally score more goals on behalf of their team than other players.
